# Body Diff JSON (Request Body Incremental Comparison)

## Background

Claude Code's MainAgent uses a full-context sending mechanism — each request carries the complete conversation history, system prompt, tool definitions, and more. This means the request body grows increasingly large as the conversation progresses, making it difficult to quickly identify "what was actually added this round" when viewing the raw body.

Body Diff JSON solves exactly this problem: it automatically compares the bodies of two consecutive MainAgent requests, extracts the incremental differences, and lets you see at a glance what content was actually added in the current request.

## How It Works

1. **Identify consecutive MainAgent requests**: The current request must be a MainAgent type, and a previous MainAgent request must exist
2. **Field-by-field comparison**: Iterates through all top-level fields of the request body, skipping internal properties prefixed with `_`
3. **Smart diff extraction**:
   - New fields: Displayed directly
   - Deleted fields: Not shown (usually doesn't affect understanding)
   - Changed fields: Shows the current value
   - `messages` array special handling: Only shows newly added messages (since normal conversation is append-only, prefix messages remain unchanged)
4. **Request body shrinkage detection**: If the current request body is smaller than the previous one, it indicates context truncation or session reset, and a notice is displayed instead of a diff

## Typical Scenarios

In a normal conversation round, Body Diff JSON typically contains only:
- `messages`: 1-2 newly added messages (the user's input + the assistant's reply from the previous round)

If you see changes to `system`, `tools`, `model`, or other fields in the diff, it means a configuration change occurred in this round, which is often the cause of a cache rebuild.

## Usage

- Body Diff JSON is displayed in the MainAgent request detail panel
- Click the title to expand/collapse
- Supports both JSON and Text viewing modes, plus one-click copy
- In the top-left **Glasshouse → Global Settings**, you can set "Expand Body Diff JSON by default"
