# UltraPlan — The Ultimate Wishing Machine

## What is UltraPlan

UltraPlan is Glasshouse's **localized implementation** of Claude Code's native `/ultraplan` command. It allows you to use the full capabilities of `/ultraplan` in your local environment **without needing to launch Claude's official remote service**, guiding Claude Code to accomplish complex planning and implementation tasks using **multi-agent collaboration**.

Compared to regular Plan mode or Agent Team, UltraPlan can:
- Offer **Code Expert** and **Research Expert** roles tailored for different task types
- Deploy multiple parallel agents to explore the codebase or conduct research from different dimensions
- Incorporate external research (webSearch) for industry best practices
- Automatically assemble a Code Review Team after plan execution for code review
- Form a complete **Plan → Execute → Review → Fix** closed loop

## Important Notes

### 1. UltraPlan Is Not Omnipotent
UltraPlan is a more powerful wishing machine, but that doesn't mean every wish can be fulfilled. It's more powerful than Plan and Agent Team, but it can't directly "make you money." Consider reasonable task granularity — break large goals into executable medium-sized tasks rather than trying to accomplish everything in one shot.

### 2. Currently Most Effective for Programming Projects
UltraPlan's templates and workflows are deeply optimized for programming projects. Other scenarios (documentation, data analysis, etc.) can be attempted, but you may want to wait for future version adaptations.

### 3. Execution Time and Context Window Requirements
- A successful UltraPlan run typically takes **30 minutes or more**
- Requires MainAgent to have a large context window (1M context Opus model recommended)
- If you only have a 200K model, **make sure to `/clear` context before running**
- Claude Code's `/compact` performs poorly when the context window is insufficient — avoid running out of space
- Maintaining sufficient context space is a critical prerequisite for successful UltraPlan execution

If you have any questions or suggestions about the localized UltraPlan, feel free to open [Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) to discuss and collaborate.

## How It Works

UltraPlan offers two expert roles, tailored for different types of tasks:

### Code Expert
A multi-agent collaboration workflow designed for programming projects:
1. Deploy up to 5 parallel agents to explore the codebase simultaneously (architecture, file identification, risk assessment, etc.)
2. Optionally deploy a research agent to investigate industry solutions via webSearch
3. Synthesize all agent findings into a detailed implementation plan
4. Deploy a review agent to scrutinize the plan from multiple perspectives
5. Execute the plan once approved
6. Automatically assemble a Code Review Team to validate code quality after implementation

### Research Expert
A multi-agent collaboration workflow designed for research and analysis tasks:
1. Deploy multiple parallel agents to research from different dimensions (industry surveys, academic papers, news articles, competitor analysis, etc.)
2. Assign an agent to synthesize the target solution while verifying the rigor and credibility of gathered papers, news, and research reports
3. Optionally deploy an agent to create a product demo (HTML, Markdown, etc.)
4. Synthesize all agent findings into a comprehensive implementation plan
5. Deploy multiple review agents to scrutinize the plan from different roles and perspectives
6. Execute the plan once approved

## Raw Templates

Below are the two raw prompt templates UltraPlan actually sends to Claude Code (see `src/utils/ultraplanTemplates.js`):

### Code Expert (codeExpert)

<textarea readonly><system-reminder>
[SCOPED INSTRUCTION] The following instructions apply only to the next 1–3 interactions. Once the task is complete, these instructions should gradually decrease in priority and no longer affect subsequent interactions.

Pre-requisite: Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify user intent whenever the request is ambiguous (target element, interaction style, scope of platforms, etc.). Skip only if the intent is unambiguous.

Leverage a multi-agent exploration mechanism to formulate a highly detailed implementation plan.

Instructions:
1. Use the `Agent` tool to spawn parallel agents that simultaneously explore different aspects of the codebase:
- If necessary, assign a preliminary researcher to use the `webSearch` tool to first investigate cutting-edge solutions in the relevant industry domain;
- One agent responsible for understanding the relevant existing code and architecture;
- One agent responsible for identifying all files that need to be modified;
- One agent responsible for identifying potential risks, edge cases, and dependencies;
- You may add other roles or deploy additional agents beyond the three listed above; the maximum number of concurrently dispatched agents is 5.

2. Synthesize the findings from all agents into a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.

3. Use the `Agent` tool to spawn 2-3 review agents that examine the plan from different perspectives, checking for missing steps, potential risks, or corresponding mitigation strategies.

4. Integrate the feedback gathered during the review process, then call `ExitPlanMode` to submit your final plan.

5. Once `ExitPlanMode` returns a result:
- If approved: proceed to execute the plan within this session.
- If rejected: revise the plan based on the feedback provided and call `ExitPlanMode` again.
- If an error occurs (including receiving a "Not in Plan Mode" message): do **not** follow the suggestions provided in the error message; instead, prompt the user for further instructions.

Your final plan must include the following elements:
- A clear summary of the implementation strategy;
- An ordered list of files to be created or modified, with precise details of the required changes for each file;
- A step-by-step execution sequence;
- Testing and validation procedures;
- Potential risks and their corresponding mitigation strategies;

6. After the final plan has been successfully executed:
First run `git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet` (or equivalent) to detect whether the working tree actually has non-trivial changes; if there are no real changes (or only whitespace/comment-only edits), skip the UltraReview step.
Otherwise, if the project is managed with Git:
Initiate a team (`TeamCreate`), dynamically allocating the number of teammates based on task complexity (5 is recommended);
Task: Conduct a Code Review of the current git changes from multiple perspectives;
Pre-requisites:
- The git repository may be located in a subdirectory of the current directory; prefer `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (fall back to recursive lookup) before proceeding;
- In the case of multiple repositories, tasks may be executed separately;
The team's goal is to analyze the current Git change log and validate each modification from different perspectives, specifically including:
- Whether requirements/objectives have been met and functionality is complete;
- Whether newly added code introduces side effects, breaks existing functionality, or poses potential risks;
- Code quality: naming, readability, complexity, technical debt, maintainability;
- Testing and documentation: whether there is adequate test coverage, and whether critical logic has necessary comments or documentation;
- Dependencies and compatibility: whether new dependencies or version compatibility issues have been introduced;
Workflow:
- Each teammate, according to their own role, covers the review dimensions one by one and independently outputs a report;
- After consolidating the reports, perform a cross-review to identify conflicts or shared concerns;
- Distill specific, actionable modification suggestions and annotate them with priority levels (P0/P1/P2/P3);
- Upon completion, adopt P0 items, and selectively adopt P1 items when they are concrete and low-risk; defer P2/P3 to backlog;
- After execution is complete, close the team (`TeamDelete`);

### Research Expert (researchExpert)

<textarea readonly><system-reminder>
[SCOPED INSTRUCTION] The following instructions are intended for the next 1–3 interactions. Once the task is complete, these instructions should be gradually deprioritized and no longer influence subsequent interactions.

Pre-requisite: Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify the research scope, target audience, and deliverable format whenever the user's intent is ambiguous. Skip only if the intent is unambiguous.

Leverage a multi-agent exploration mechanism to formulate an exceptionally detailed implementation plan.

Instructions:
1. Utilize the Agent tool to spawn parallel agents that simultaneously explore various facets of the requirements:
- If necessary, deploy a preliminary investigator to conduct an initial survey of industry-specific solutions using `webSearch`;
- If necessary, deploy a specialized investigator to research authoritative sources—such as academic papers, news articles, and research reports—using `webSearch`;
- Assign an agent to synthesize the target solution, while simultaneously verifying the rigor and credibility of the gathered papers, news, and research reports;
- If necessary, assign an agent to analyze competitor data to provide supplementary analytical perspectives;
- If necessary, assign an agent to handle the implementation of a product demo (generating outputs such as HTML, Markdown, etc.);
- If the task is sufficiently complex, you may assign additional teammates to the roles defined above, or introduce other specialized roles; you are permitted to schedule up to 5 teammates concurrently.

2. Synthesize the findings from the aforementioned agents into a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan.

3. Utilize the Agent tool to spawn a set of parallel review agents; these agents shall scrutinize the plan from multiple roles and perspectives to identify any omitted steps and to propose reasonable additions or optimizations.

4. Consolidate the feedback received from the review agents, then invoke `ExitPlanMode` to submit your final plan.

5. Upon receiving the result from `ExitPlanMode`:
- If Approved: Proceed to execute the plan within this current session.
- If Rejected: Revise the plan based on the provided feedback, and then invoke `ExitPlanMode` once again.
- If an Error Occurs (including the message "Not in Plan Mode"): Do *not* follow the suggestions provided by the error message; instead, prompt the user for further instructions.

Your final plan must include the following elements:
- A clear summary of the proposed implementation strategy;
- An ordered list of files to be created or modified, specifying the exact changes required for each;
- A step-by-step sequence for executing the implementation;
- Identification of potential risks and corresponding mitigation strategies;
- Creative ideation and suggestions for advanced enhancements;
- If a product demo was generated, place the corresponding demo output in an appropriate location and notify the user.
