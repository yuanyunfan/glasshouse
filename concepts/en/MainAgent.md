# MainAgent

## Definition

MainAgent is the primary request chain in Claude Code when not in agent team mode. Every interaction between the user and Claude Code produces a series of API requests, where MainAgent requests form the core conversation chain — they carry the complete system prompt, tool definitions, and message history.

## Identification

In Glasshouse, MainAgent is identified by `req.mainAgent === true`, automatically tagged by `interceptor.js` during request capture.

Criteria (all must be met):
- The request body contains a `system` field (system prompt)
- The request body contains a `tools` array (tool definitions)
- The system prompt contains "Claude Code" signature text
